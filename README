SIGNUM

This is a password manager written in (basically) pure V.
Why I wrote this? Simple. I hate GPG.

Depends heavily on ccrypt (https://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/), and this software will
refuse to run without it.

Benefits over PASS:
- You can have different passwords for different files (dunno why you would want to do this)
- Absolutely no information required, except your password

Important Stuff:
Since this ins't a software that uses GPG, we will ask you for passwords a lot.
And of course, ccrypt double checks your password, but if you type any password wrong
while creating, it will be lost forever.

Big Thanks to Pete Selinger (Author of ccrypt)
